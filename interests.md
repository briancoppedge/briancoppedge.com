### Interests

"Traveling" usually feels like a cop-out answer, but I've been to 31 countries and counting, so I feel like it's legit. Where's my favorite place I have been you ask? That's tough, but I think Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa has some of the best views you could ask for! And, I've spent a lot of time in India, so I've gotta say the Taj Mahal is pretty cool, too. 

I've also recently taken an interest in web design, and this little site is the result.
