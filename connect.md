## Connect

Hey, there! I'm always looking to meet new people, learn new skills and take on new adventures. So, let's connect! Some of my favorite topics include travel, religion, sports and history. A friend of mine gave me the idea to share things I'm looking to learn as well as things I can help others with on my website, so here it goes:

Skills I'd like to learn...
- web design and coding
- consulting
- private pilot's license
- building and house projects 
- real estate

Knowledge I love to share with others...
- travel planning (finding the best flights, where to stay, what to do, etc.)
- earning credit card points to make your aforementioned travels affordable
- Bible study
- innovative management practices

My email is brian.coppedge@hotmail.com...shoot me a line!
