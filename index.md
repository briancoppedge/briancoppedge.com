## Welcome to my website!

Please feel free to take a look around and get to know me a bit. You can find information regarding my professional experience, hobbies and interests. 


### About Me

A true native of Colorado, I now call Dallas, Texas home. I live with my beautiful wife, Jess, and my fledgling bonsai tree, Rex, that I planted from a stocking stuffer I received for Christmas this year...if he grows big and strong enough, I think I'll shape him into a tyrannosaurus rex.

Jess and I love traveling and have been to 25-30 countries each. We also enjoy hiking, picnicing, dancing and making fun music videos. 

But, the most important thing to know about me is that I am follower of Christ. I won't bother if you don't, but I thoroughly enjoy spiritual conversations and would love to have one with you!

### Professional Experience

As a seasoned and innovative leader with significant cross-cultural experience, I desire to leverage my management, communication and problem solving skills to advance key objectives and improve organizational effectiveness.

### Hobbies

"Traveling" usually feels like a cop-out answer, but I've been to 31 countries and counting, so I feel like it's legit. Where's my favorite place I have been you ask? That's tough, but I think Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa has some of the best views you could ask for! And, I've spent a lot of time in India, so I've gotta say the Taj Mahal is pretty cool, too. 


### Interests
I've recently taken an interest in web development, and this little site is the result.
