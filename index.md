## Glad you're here!

Welcome to my personal website! Please feel free to take a look around and get to know me a bit. You can find information regarding my professional experience, hobbies and interests. 




### Professional Experience

As a seasoned and innovative leader with significant cross-cultural experience, I desire to leverage my management, communication and problem solving skills to advance key objectives and improve organizational effectiveness. To see what I've done, hop on over to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-coppedge/). 

### Hobbies

"Traveling" usually feels like a cop-out answer, but I've been to 31 countries and counting, so I feel like it's legit. Where's my favorite place I have been you ask? That's tough, but I think Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa has some of the best views you could ask for! And, I've spent a lot of time in India, so I've gotta say the Taj Mahal is pretty cool, too. 


### Interests
I've recently taken an interest in web development, and this little site is the result.
