A true native of Colorado, I now call Dallas, Texas home. I live here with my beautiful wife, Jess, and my fledgling bonsai tree, Rex,  which I planted from a Christmas stocking stuffer...if he grows big and strong enough, I think I'll shape him into a Tyrannosaurus.

Jess and I love traveling and have been to 25-30 countries each. We also enjoy hiking, picnicing, dancing and making awesome music videos. You should check 'em out.

But, the most important thing to know about me is that I am follower of Christ. I won't bother if you don't, but I thoroughly enjoy spiritual conversations and would love to have one with you!
